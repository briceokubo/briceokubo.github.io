                     The Hackathon consisted over +100 applicants, which included students, entrepreneurs, and professional developers. The goal was to create a mobile application incorporating AT&amp;T tracking API. With 24- hours on the clock, my team of 4 software developers, and I (UI designer) set out to create a working prototype of our mobile application that will keep hikers safe.

                  <p class="HAtext">
                     With our key features planned out by the lead developer of the group, I was designated to create a user interface that would impress the judges and make our application stand out from the rest of the other teams.

                     Our application, Hike Aloha, was awarded the grand award of “Best Overall Mobile App”. Our product design, my user interface design, and overall viability of the application received high praise from the University of Hawaii President David Lassner, Governor David Ige, and the rest of the judging panel.

               After winning the AT&amp;T Hackathon, mobile development of Hike Aloha continued. On March 2016, Hike Aloha was launched on the Google Play Store.

            <p class="HAtext">
               Thanks to a great community and friends, we were able to receive feedback from our users in Oahu’s hiking community. In 2017, Hike Aloha stopped receiving support. Our users now await our next upcoming mobile app, which will be an evolution of Hike Aloha, called Modern Compass.

               This project was my first experience transitioning from a graphic design to a UI design. Working on this has given me the passion to continue pursuing a career in UX and web designing. With future upcoming projects, I will continue to expand my repertoire of design sense and continue to learn from my experiences.
