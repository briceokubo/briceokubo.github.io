            <p class="HAtext">
               With a group of 5 ( 4 developer, and 1 UI designer) we applied as a team in AT&T Hackathon in Hawai’i.  With a pitch of one developer passion of hiking, wanted to create a mobile application that would be resource for hikers and as well as a safety mechanism for them.
            </p>
            <p class="HAtext">
               24 hour timer, we were set out to create a working prototype of our mobile application ptich. With our key features already planned out by the lead developer of the group, I was set to create a user interface that would impress the judges and make our application standout from the rest of the teams.
            </p>
            <p class="HAtext">
               Being the last team to submit our form, we presented our working prototype and recieved little feedback from the Q&A.  For us, it was a sleepless struggle of working, testing and were just glad that we completed our prototype on time.

            <p class="HAtext">
               With four categories of awards, “Best AT&T M2X App”, “Best UI” Best Government & Resources App” and grand awards “Best Overall Mobile App”, we had our hopes to win at least on of the awards for our relentless efforts. After the three small awards were announced, our hopes were gone and told one another on  great job we did in such a small time. Then the announcement of grand award going to “Hike Aloha”, we jumped up from joy and the unthinkable.

            <p class="HAtext">
               After receiving great praise from the judges, which included the President of the University of Hawaii David Lassner, and Hawaii Governor David Ige, it was our product design, user interface, and overall  viability of the application that made their decision.

      <p class="HAtext">
         This project was my first experience from a graphic designer to UI/UX designer and boy, it was an eye opener. Without this project, I wouldn't be here with the passion of a UX and web designer. From Hike Aloha to the next project onwards, I am always growing my design sense and learning more to my own development.
