      <h1>Carbon Neutral Challenge Case Study</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
         Design a web application to keep track of users carbon emission to help save the world! Camilo Mora, University of Hawaii Manoa Professor, is spreading news of a new upcoming web application to help you keep track of the trees you plant to counter act the carbon emission you create.

      <h2>Sitemap</h2>
      <p>
         Once we gather all the features for the web application, i created a wireframe/ sitemap.

      <div class="row">
         <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
            <img class="img-responsive workImg" src="content/images/CNsitemap.png">
         </div>
         <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            <img class="img-responsive workImg" src="content/images/signupsitemap.png">
         </div>
      </div>
      <h2>Wireframe</h2>
      <p>
         For the profile, we wanted to create a basic layout for users to be navigate easily. But with enough space to add on more features that users will have access to in the future.

      <h2>Possible Solution</h2>
      <p>
         While creating the wireframes and attempting to track my own carbon emission, I came across issues of trying input my own data in the carbon calculator.
         A lot of the fillable field, required information that would not be easily answered by a child or adult.
         A guide or help button would be needed to help user estimate the amount of food, miles, and etc information needed to calculate your emission.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
         This project was a great experience for myself. From my experience in IT support side of the department, i was able to translate my experience with customers to the UX side of the website to make the UX design are targeted to the right audience.
