               24-hour timer, a team of 4 software developers, and 1 UI designer set out to create a working prototype of a mobile application that will keep hikers safe. With our key features already planned out by the lead developer of the group, I was designated to create a user interface that would impress the judges and make our application standout from the rest of the other teams.

               Hike Aloha was awarded with the grand award of  “Best Overall Mobile App”. After receiving great praise from the judges, which included the President of the University of Hawaii David Lassner, and Hawaii Governor David Ige, it was our product design, my user interface design, and overall viability of the application that solidified their decision.

         After winning the AT&T Hackathon, mobile development of Hike Aloha continued. March 2016, Hike Aloha launched on the Google Play Store.            </p>
      <p class="HAtext">
         With a great community and friends, we were able to grab feedback from our users in Oahu’s hiking community. As of 2017, Hike Aloha stopped receiving support. Our users now await our next upcoming mobile app, which will be an evolution of Hike Aloha, called Modern Compass.

         This project was my first experience transitioning from a graphic designer to a UI designer. Working on this has given me the passion to continue pursing a career in UX and web designing. With future upcoming projects, I will continue to expand my design sense and learn from my experiences.
