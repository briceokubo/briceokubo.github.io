            <h2 class="workHeader">What is Carbon Neutrality Challenge?</h2>
            <p class="HAtext">
               Carbon Neutrality Challenge is a web application to keep track of user’s carbon emission and track their planted tree growth to help save the world.
            <p class="HAtext">
               With this application, we hope to instill simple user interface and gameification attributes such as competing with other people around the world, by comparing user’s carbon emission to encourage users to lower their emission rate.

      <h2 class="workHeader">Wireframe</h2>
      <p class="HAtext">
         My focus was creating a simple interface suitable for users of all ages. After an interview with University of Hawaii Manoa Professor Camilo Mora, the founder of Carbon Neutrality Challenge, we were able to collect user experience with selected Oahu elementary schools that participated in the first field test using Carbon Neutrality Challenge. With this information, I was able to formulate an interface that would be needed to support design challenges for the children’s needs.

            <p class="HAtext">
               While designing the wireframes, I came across user issues of inputting accurate data in the carbon calculator. The web application is intended for children to adults, enabling them to accurately fill out the required boxes with information that would not be so readily accessible.
            </p>
            <p class="HAtext">
               Creating a data input system for children and adults was a design challenge. The solutions we designed was a help button to display instructions and current average calculations.

         This was a great opportunity and learning experience collaborating with Professor Mora to help design and spread the word of his upcoming web application. Carbon Neutrality Challenge is still under development, and hopes to have a launch date in 2017.
