            <h2 class="workHeader">What is Carbon Neutrality Challenge?</h2>
            <p class="HAtext">
               Carbon Neutrality Challenge is a web application to keep track of user’s carbon emission and track their planted tree growth to help save the world.             </p>
            <p class="HAtext">
               With this application, we hope to instill easy user interface and gameification attributes to encourage users to continue planting trees. Gameification features such as, competing with other people in their city, state, country and world by comparing user’s carbon emission and see who can lower their carbon emission by planting trees or life style.

      <p class="HAtext">
         My focus was creating a simple interface suitable for users of all ages. After interview with University of Hawaii Manoa Professor Camilo Mora, the founder of Carbon Neutrality Challenge, we were able to note his experience with his first couple runs with children at certain elementary that were apart of the first run of Carbon Neutral. With the this information, I was able to formulate a interface that would be needed to suffice design challenge for children needs.

            <p class="HAtext">
               While designing the wireframes, I came across user experience issues of input my own data in the carbon calculator. The web application is intended for child to adults to be able to fill out, but  a lot of the fillable field, required information that will not be easily answered by a child nor an adult.
            </p>
            <p class="HAtext">
               Creating a data input system for children and adults was a design challenge. The solutions we implement was a help button to display instructions and live average calculation.

      <p class="HAtext">
         This was a great opportunity and learning experience. Collaborating with Professor Mora to help design and spread the word of his upcoming web application.  Carbon Neutrality Challenge is still under development, and hopes to have a launch date of 2017.
