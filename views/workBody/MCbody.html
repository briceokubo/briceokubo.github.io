            The entire digital project was developed by a small team. With the enormous amount of outdoor activities in the world, crowdsourcing will be our main source of information. With crowdsourcing, Modern Compass will be flexible and able to seamlessly evolve and grow

         <p class="HAtext">
            As our team develops Modern Compass, I want to make sure we are developing an application that users want.  In each phase of production, we are product designing each feature and conclude whether our not the feature is essential to our goal in Modern Compass.
            <!-- Collaborative discussion on information architecture, we developed guidelines for the overall digital appearance based on colors, shapes, images and graphics. -->
         </p>
         <p class="HAtext">
            Through conference calls and slack polls, we as a team do weekly scrum stand up, to give individual check in to our progress and any concerns.  As open team, we highly encourage critiques and constructive arguments to further our learning and growth.
            <!-- Because of a agile workflow every production step had to be outlined with wireframes, prototypes or final design previews, but always open for changes at any point of time of production. -->
