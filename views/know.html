            <p>I was orginally a graphic designer. It was only by accident that I stumbled upon web development. But ever since then,
               I fell in love with it. Web development is like a never ending journey of learning, and what a great experience it has been.
               My focus is <b>UX, UI and web graphics</b> projects.
