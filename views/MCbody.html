            The entire digital project was developed by a small team. With the enormous amount of outdoor activities in the world, crowdsourcing will be our main source of information. With crowdsourcing, Modern Compass will be flexible and able to seamlessly evolve and grow
         </p>
         <p class="HAtext">
            Collaborative discussion on information architecture, we developed guidelines for the overall digital appearance based on colors, shapes, images and graphics.

         <p class="HAtext">
            Because of a agile workflow every production step had to be outlined with simple scribbled wireframes, prototypes or final design previews, but always open for changes at any point of time of production.
