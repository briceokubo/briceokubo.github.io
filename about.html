                  My name is Brice Okubo. I am a web developer and UX designer focused on creating polished user experiences through versatile and creative designs. Through ux research, I am able to understand and build solutions that will serve the user’s needs.

               <p class="aboutSum">
                  In 2015, my colleagues and I received an award for our winning mobile application at AT&amp;T Hackathon. It was after this experience that I realized that I had an interest in user experience and decided that this is the career path I want to pursue.
               </p>
               <p class="aboutSum">
                  I’m currently working as a UI/UX Designer at a startup company, Modern Compass. Prior to this I worked at the University of Hawaii Manoa Bookstore as the office assistant to the computer department and marketing department with web design.
