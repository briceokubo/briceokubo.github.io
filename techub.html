            <p class="HAtext">
               University of Hawaii Manoa Bookstore is now allowing students, faculty and staff to purchase Apple products with educational pricing through their E-commerce site. With the big news, the computer department rebrands itself to TecHub and redesigned the department webpage.
            </p>
            <h2 class="workHeader">Goals</h2>
            <p class="HAtext">
               Through personal experience using the computer department webpage and direction from the store managers, our team set out to accomplish three goals:
            </p>
            <ul class="HAtext">
               <li>Simple navigation</li>
      	      <li>Consistent design with other department webpages</li>
      	      <li>Easily maintainable</li>

               <h3 class="MCsubtitle">Desktop </h3>
               <p class="HAtext white">
                  My focus was providing simple, user friendly interface that will guide users to their desired section. I did some initial research on the target audience, on which products and questions are frequently asked via in person and on telephone.
               </p>
               <p class="HAtext white">
                  Based on my research, we were able to validate the three main sections that users are frequently targeting and able to place them in a quick link on the homepage for direct access.

            <p class="HAtext">
               Though not all computer products are available through the e-commerce store, we are required to display other products through various methods. With the constant change of products that we bring in, the marketing department is not able to keep up. I created a solution that utilizes the old departmentâ€™s CMS to host the PDF pages that will display the non-e-commerce products linked from the new TecHub page.

            <p class="HAtext">
               The redesign TecHub has received praise from students, faculty, and staff. The new feature to purchase an Apple computer from the bookstore website has been positively received by parents and fiscal officers due to convenience and streamline process; an improvement from credit card transactions over the phone.
